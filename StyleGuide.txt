WADsworth Programmer's Style Guide:

- No line will have more than 100 columns

- All functions, global variables, and constants must have an associated comment describing what
they do
    - All code being refered to inside a comment must be surrounded in square brackets

    - All macros must have an associated comment too, and if the macro is function like, then the
    types of each argument and the return value must be written explicitly in said comment

    - Any code you think might *not* be self-evident to the outside reader probably isn't, so
    comment that too

- All programmer defined types are in pascal case, all typedefs of primitive types are in snake
case, all constants are in upper snake case.

- Handle all cases and check all error codes, even if you're just gonna crash the program if reached

- Prefer to indent with four spaces instead of one tab
